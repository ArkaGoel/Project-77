        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Enviornment) in which we write high level programming language which is understood by us and the computer shows the output by converting it into low level programming language</p>
        <p>Console is used to check if the code is running properly before running it. You can open console screen by Inspect Element or by pressing F12</p>
